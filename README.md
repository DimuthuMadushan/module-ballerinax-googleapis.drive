Google Drive encompasses Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Slides, which are a part of the Google Docs Editors office suite that permits the collaborative editing of documents, spreadsheets, presentations, drawings, forms, and more.

The connector supports file and folder management operations related to creating, deleting, updating and retrieving.
